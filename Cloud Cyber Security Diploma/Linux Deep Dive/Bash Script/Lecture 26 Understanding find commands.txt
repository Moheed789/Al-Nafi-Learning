Lecture 26 : Understanding Find Commands

In this lecture, we studied the find command in Linux, which is used to search for files and directories in a directory hierarchy based on various criteria like name, type, size,
user, group, permission, and modification time. We also learned how to use the -exec option to perform actions on the search results. This lecture gives a comprehensive overview
of file searching and handling in Linux using find.

Find Syntax

The general syntax of the find command is:
Example:
    find <path> <action> <file or patterns>

1. Search for a file in the current directory

This command searches for a file named abd1.txt in the current directory and all its subdirectories.
Example:
    find . -name abd1.txt

2. Search for a file in a specific path

This command searches for abd1.txt in the directory /root/bash/lect26/files.
Example:
    find /root/bash/lect26/files -name abd1.txt

3. Find directories with a specific name

This command searches for directories named abd in the current directory and below.
Example:
    find . -type d -name abd

4. Find files with a specific name

This command searches for files named abd (not directories).

Example:
    find . -group root

8. Find files with 0755 permissions

This command shows all files with exact permission set to 0755.
Example:
    find . -type f -perm 0755 -print

9. Find files where user has read permission

This command finds files where the user has read permission (u=r).
Example:
    find . -perm /u=r

10. Delete all .txt files in a specific directory

This command deletes all .txt files found under /root/bash/lect26/files/dir1.
Example:
    find /root/bash/lect26/files/dir1 -type f -name "*.txt" -exec rm -f {} \;

11. Change permission of directories with 777 to 755

This command finds all directories with 777 permission and changes them to 755.
Example:
    find . -type d  -perm 777 -print -exec chmod 755 {} \;

12. Find empty files (size 0)

This command finds all empty files.
Example:
    find . -type f -size 0

13. Count empty files

This command counts the number of empty files found.
Example:
    find . -type f -size 0 | wc -l

14. Find hidden files

This command lists all hidden files (starting with a dot).
Example:
    find . -type f -name ".*"

15. Find directories modified within the last 10 days

This command finds directories modified in the last 10 days using -mtime -10.
Example:

16. Find files changed in the last 60 minutes

Example:
    find . -size 50M

18. Find files modified in the last 2 hours
