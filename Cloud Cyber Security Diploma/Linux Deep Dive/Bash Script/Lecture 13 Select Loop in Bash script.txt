Lecture 13 : Select Loop in Bash script.

This lecture explains different types of loops in Bash scripting, focusing especially on the Select Loop, which is useful for creating menu-driven programs. It covers the 
syntax and usage of the case statement used with user input, and shows real examples of implementing basic choices and file-based menus using select and case

1. Loop Types

In Bash, there are multiple types of loops that help automate repetitive tasks. The commonly used loop types include:
1. For Loop: Iterates over a list or range of items.
2. While Loop: Runs a block of code while a condition is true.
3. While IFS Loop: Reads input line by line using Internal Field Separator.
4. Until Loop: Runs until a certain condition becomes true.

Select Loop: Ideal for interactive menu-based programs.

2. Select Loop: Used for menu-driven program

The Select Loop is a special kind of loop in Bash scripting. It is commonly used to create simple menu systems where the user selects an option from a list. The value selected 
is stored in a variable and used in a case statement.

3. Select Loop Syntax

Hereâ€™s the structure of a typical Select Loop using a case statement.
Syntax:
    case <variable> in
    pattern)
        statement
    ;;
    patter)
        statement
    ;;
    *)
        statement
    ;;
    esac

4. Simple Case Menu Example

Example:
    cat simple.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "Please enter the number betweeen 1 to 3"
    read num
    case $num in
    1)
        echo "You have enter the one number"
    ;;
    2)
        echo "You have enter two"
    ;;
    3)
        echo "You have enter the Three"
    ;;
    *)
        echo "Sorry You have enter the wrong number"
    ;;
    esac

5. Output Example: Correct Option 

Example:
    ./simple.sh
    Please enter the number betweeen 1 to 3
    2
    You have enter two

6. Output Example: Invalid Option

Example:
    ./simple.sh
    Please enter the number betweeen 1 to 3
    4
    Sorry You have enter the wrong number

7. Output Example: Valid Option

Example:
    ./simple.sh
    Please enter the number between 1 to 3
    1
    You have enter the one number

8. File Extension Case Menu Example

This script lets the user input a file extension and lists all matching files using a case structure.
Example:
    #!/bin/bash
    clear
    echo "Enter your file extension: "
    read ext
    case $ext in
    ".txt")
        Is-ltrh *.txt
    ;;
    ".sh")
        Is -ltrh *.sh
    ;;
    *)
        echo "Sorry, You have enter the invalid file extention"
    ;;
    esac

9. Menu Driven Script with Options

This script displays a menu with system information options and performs actions based on the user's choice.
Example:
    cat menudriven.sh
    #/bin/bash
    echo -e "\n1. Operating System information\n"
    echo -e "\n2. Hostaname inforamtion\n"
    echo -e "\n3. Memory details\n"
    echo -e "\n4. My disk usage\n"
    echo -e "\n5 Exit\n"
    echo "Enter your choice"
    read choice
    case $choice in
    1)
        echo "Your linux system information: $(uname -a)"
    ;;
    2)
        echo "Hostname is: $(hostname)"
    ;;
    3)
    echo "$(free-g)"
    ;;
    4)
        echo "$(df-h)"
    ;;
    5)
        echo "Bye Bye"
        exit 1
    ;;
    esac
