Lecture 14 : Introduction to Echo commands flag and Advance bash script commands.

In this lecture, we explored the echo command with -e flag to interpret backslash escape characters in Bash scripting. This allows us to add formatting like newlines, tabs, 
alerts, and more into our outputs. We also learned about special Bash scripting methods like here documents (cat <<) and file redirection. Additionally, we covered the tr 
command for case conversion and how to write both single and multi-line comments in Bash scripts.

Note:

The -e option with the echo command enables interpretation of backslash escapes.

1. \ --> Backslash for Double Quotes

To print double quotes inside a string, we use the backslash (\) to escape them.
Example:
    echo -e "My name is \"Abdeali Dodiya\", I am from Bangalore, India"
    My name is "Abdeali Dodiya", I am from Bangalore, India

2. \a --> Alert (BEL)

This escape character triggers an alert sound (bell), though it might not be audible on all systems.
Example:
    echo -e "\aMy sample shell script"
    My sample shell script

3. \b --> Backspace

It removes the character before it.
Example:
    echo -e "Abde\bali Dodiya"
    Abdali Dodiya

    echo -e "Abdeali \bDodiya"
    AbdealiDodiya

4. \c --> Suppress Trailing Newline

It suppresses the part of the string after \c.
Example:
    echo -e "Abdeali Dodiya, \nI am from\c Bangalore"
    Abdeali Dodiya,
    I am from

5. \f --> Form Feed

This inserts a form feed character, which can clear or skip a page on some terminals.
Example:
    echo -e "\fAbdeali Dodiya, \nl am from Bangalore"
    Abdeali Dodiya,
    I am from Bangalore

6. \n --> New Line

Used to move the cursor to the next line.
Example:
    #echo -e "Abdeali Dodiya, \nI am from Bangalore"
    Abdeali Dodiya,
    I am from Bangalore

7. \t --> Horizontal Tab

Inserts a horizontal tab (space).
Example:
    echo -e "Abdeali Dodiya from bangalore"
    Abdeali Dodiya from bangalore

    echo -e "Abdeali Dodiya from \tbangalore"
    Abdeali Dodiya from bangalore

    echo -e "Abdeali Dodiya from \t\tbangalore"
    Abdeali Dodiya from bangalore

    echo -e "Abdeali Dodiya from \t\t\tbangalore"
    Abdeali Dodiya from
    bangalore

8. \v --> Vertical Tab

Inserts a vertical tab between text.
Example:
    echo -e "Abdeali Dodiya from \vBangalore"
    Abdeali Dodiya from
    Bangalore

    echo -e "Abdeali Dodiya from \v\tBangalore"
    Abdeali Dodiya from
    Bangalore

9. Script to Display Current User and Directory

This script uses environment variables like $USER and $PWD to display the current username and working directory.
Example:
    cat HS.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    echo "My current user is $USER"
    echo "My current working direction is $PWD"

10. Script Execution Output

After executing the script, it prints current user and path.
Example:
    ./HS.sh
    My current user is root
    My current working directory is /root/bash/lect14

11 Using Here Document (cat <<)

This method uses cat << to print multiple lines with variables.
Example:
    cat HS.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    cat << ABD 
    My current user is $USER
    My current working directory is $PWD
    ABD

12. Output Redirection to File

We can redirect script output into a file using >> or >.
Example:
    ./HS.sh >> file1.txt
    cat file1.txt
    My current user is root
    My current working directory is /root/bash/lect14

Using cat << and redirecting to a new file:

    cat HS.sh
    #!/bin/bash
    cat << ABD > file2.txt
    My current user is $USER
    My current working directory is $PWD    
    ABD

13. Convert Lowercase to Uppercase using Pipe

The tr command can be used to convert case via a pipe.
Example:
    echo "We are learning bash at Alnafi" | tr [a-z] [A-Z]
    WE ARE LEARNING BASH AT ALNAFI

14. Convert String to Uppercase Using Here String

Using <<< to directly pass a string to tr.
Example:
    tr [a-z] [A-Z] <<< "we are learning bash at alnafi"
    WE ARE LEARNING BASH AT ALNAFI

15. Variable Declaration and Access

A string variable is declared and accessed using $.
Example:
    echo $abd
    we are learning bash at alnafi

16. Convert Variable to Uppercase

The variable content is passed to tr for uppercase conversion.
Example:
    tr [a-z] [A-Z] <<< $abd
    WE ARE LEARNING BASH AT ALNAFI
    DOCKER VERSION 20.10.14, BUILD A224086

17. Docker Version Check

Command to check installed Docker version.
Example:
    docker-v
    Docker version 20.10.14, build a224086

18. Comments in Bash
Single Line comments :-

Used with # before each comment line.
Example:
    #Name: Abdeali dodiya
    #Script name: comments.sh
    #Script purpose: for education
    echo "Hi"

Multi Line comments :-

Different ways to write multi-line comments in bash:
Example:
    << ABD
    Name: Abdeali dodiya
    Script name: comments.sh
    Script purpose: for education
    ABD
    echo "Hi"
    OR
    :"
    Name: Abdeali dodiya
    Script name: comments.sh
    Script purpose: for education
    "
    OR
    cat comments.sh
    :'
    Name: Abdeali dodiya
    Script name: comments.sh
    Script purpose: for education
    echo "Hi"
    '
    echo "Hi"
