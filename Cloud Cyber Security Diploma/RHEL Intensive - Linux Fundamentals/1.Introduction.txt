Why take SysOps Intensives

• RHEL Intensive & RHEL Intensive++ provides tentatively 3 months long classes, including, but not limited to Linux fundamentals, cli concepts, in-depth core admin tasks, in-depth server/application modules.
• It provides full time Linux system administration opportunity & a start for DevOps, CloudOps Cyber security paths etc.
• Prerequisites – There are no prerequisites for this course. Howerver, previous sys admin experience on different OS will be beneficial

Demo

Topics:

• Getting started with Linux
• What is Linux & how it became open source
• What we are going to learn - Red Hat concepts
• Development of RHEL - Federo / CentOS project
• Logging into CentOS GNOME env & accessing GNOME terminal
• What are command / Flags - Executing commands using shell
• Topic: Absolute paths & relative paths
• Installation of CentOS on VM virtual box

What is linux & how it became open source

• Linux is not OS. Linux is a kernel & kernel is the heart of OS.
• Unix was the oldest- Linux was invented in 1991 & it is an open source which means source code is free. Application code used in linux is free.
• Who invented open source? Linux is kernel & kernel is part of open source community under which we get all applications like apache, vlc etc code will be freely available.
• Open source invented 1984/85 by richard stallman before linux invented with name GNU as OS & opensource community.
• Then in 1991 linus torvalds developed linux kernel – kernel version 0.97 in 1991 & he gave it to GNU foundation & made this kernel as part of open source community
• And he applied open source license which is GPL [ general public license – means free licence]
• Linus torvalds also got millennium award in 2012

What we are going to learn - Red Hat !!

• Red hat v1 to v9 was free & from then Red Hat become commercial & they gave the name RHEL - Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
• Which means Red Hat v15 became RHEL 6, v16 became RHEL 7, v17 became RHEL 8
• We totally believe in concepts & we will be going deep dive on concepts which can be applied on RHEL 7 & 8
• CentOS is fully open source & mirror copy of Red Hat . Big companies like google, FB, gmailusses centos & not Red Hat as Red Hat is not open source. Ubuntu is also fully open source
• What Red Hat have done is - compiled all free open source application in an OS & giving support as per subscription.

Development of Red Hat- Federo Project

• What is Federo? Its an OS from Red Hat
• Federo is a free offering from Red Hat
• Red Hat sponsors & integrates open source projects into a community-driven Linux distribution, Federo.Red Hat participates in supporting open source projects & stabilizes the software to ensure that it is ready for LTS & standardization, and integrates it into their enterprise-ready distribution, RHEL.
• Red Hat bases its major releases of RHEL on Federo. RHEL uses subscription based model.This is not a license fee, instead it pays for support, maintenance, updates, security patches & so on.
• CentOS is community driven linux dist derived from much of open source RHEL codebase & other sources. It is free of charge – supported by active user community of volunte that operates independently of Red Hat.

Logging into CentOS GNOME env & accessing GNOME terminal

• Login screen — In linux root is the administrator – we will be creating this user while installing
• Root is good or windows administrator account is good? Upon login, right click & open terminal. Terminals are called emulators – they take input from keyboard give it to shell – shell then processes it & give it back to terminal terminal then outputs

Installation of CentOS

• We will install RHEL 7 in 7 partitions - what do you mean by partitions ? Data isolation separation. Like c, d drive these are drive letters also called partitions. If i write data on C where it will go ? C is called accesspoint for partition HD
• In linux we dont have c,d,e we have /,/boot,/var etc & in linux we dont called accesspoint - we call it mountpoints - we will go in detail in FS hierarchy module.
• 7 partitions is recomended but not necessary - minimum reqired partition to install linux is 1 only which is root - if you install in one partition, will /boot,/var will be created? Yes, it willl be created as a directory in one single partition.
• 7 partitions scheme with 15 Gb HD
/boot 512MB
/ 2GB
swap - double the RAM
/var 4GB
/tmp 1GB
/usr 4GB
/home 1GB
